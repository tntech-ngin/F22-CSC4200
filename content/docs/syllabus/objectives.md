4. the future research directions that can address those challanges. 

By the end of the course, students should be able to
1. Have an understanding of the nentworking research landcape
2. Comprehend research papers in the area of advanced networking
3. Present their work to a larger group, both orally and in writing
2. Identify and present design choices, tradeoffs, and research gaps
4. Design new network protocols and apply them to application use cases
