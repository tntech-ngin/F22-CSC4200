* We will read and discuss one networking topic each week. 
* The first class is for presentation and the follow-up class is for discussions. For example, we will present a paper on Monday, we will discuss it on Wednesday.
* For each topic, all participants will read the assigned paper and write a critical review of around 2 pages.
  1. You will write 8 critical reviews over the semester
  2. Each review will be approximately 2 pages.
* You will also fill out a survey after each class - 2 questions you want to discuss in the next class.
