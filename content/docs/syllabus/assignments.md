**[Critical Review Template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dvcrvndmnnpj)**

In this class you will 

1. Submit 8 critical reviews. *Critical reviews are due at 10AM the day the paper is first discussed*
1. This critical review is around 2 pages, [you must use this or an equivalent template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dvcrvndmnnpj). 1 inch margin, 11 point font, single spaced.
1. The critical reviews must be named **CR_FirstName_LastName_Topic_MMDD.pdf**. For example, CR_Susmit_Shannigrahi_SDN_0811.pdf.
2. You can choose which critical reviews you want write.
2. As the name suggests, you need to be critical. Your objective is to understand and find if any logical errors exist, if the evaluation does not support the hypothesis, and where things don't work. 
3. You will write about a 0.5 page summary of the paper. This will include the key concepts and the findings.
4. Identify the trade-offs made in the work. Not all solutions work everywhere - think where this solution will not work. Construct a situation where this solution will not work.
5. What are the inefficiencies? How would you address them?
6. What are the open research questions? 
7. If you wanted to redesign the study, how would you? It's fine to come up with unconventional ideas and propose large changes.
